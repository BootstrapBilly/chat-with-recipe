# 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

This project welcomes and encourages the use of AI coding assistants.

## What's Fair Game

- **LLM assistants**: Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Cursor, etc.
- **Code generation**: Generate components, hooks, styles
- **Documentation**: Ask AI to explain unfamiliar APIs
- **Debugging**: Paste errors and get help fixing them
- **Research**: Look up CopilotKit patterns, React best practices

## What We're Evaluating

We care about **outcomes** and **understanding**, not whether you typed every character:

1. **Does it work?** - Functional, handles edge cases
2. **Is it well-designed?** - Clean UI, good UX decisions
3. **Is it maintainable?** - Organized code, sensible structure
4. **Can you explain it?** - We'll ask about your decisions
5. **Did you make it yours?** - Personal touches, creative choices

## Tips for Success

- **Read the docs**: CopilotKit has great documentation
- **Start simple**: Get something working, then iterate
- **Commit often**: We'll look at your git history
- **Comment decisions**: A quick `// Chose X over Y because...` helps
- **Have fun**: This is a recipe app, make it delicious 🍳
